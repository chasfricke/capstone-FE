## App Description
Gnarly Nannies is a niche childcare service for busy families with adventurous kids. We pair professional trip leaders in your area with families looking to get their kids outside for the day. Trip experiences range from a ski trip in the mountains, to a sunset surf at your local break. Trip leaders handle everything, from transportation to meals, giving parents a much needed break. Let Gnarly Nannies provide your child with the outdoor experiences they need and deserve!

## Problem Statement
Parents don't have the knowledge, or time to support their children's outdoor sport interests.   Worried about safety, Parents are more inclined to allow their children to play indoors versus outdoors.

Adults who have transitioned out of the camping and education industry have a valuable skill set that is being underutilized. They are excellent mentors, great at leading trips, and typically have an interest in outdoor activities...as well as supplemental income.


## The Solution
Gnarly Nannies is a website that connects the parents of adventurous kids with experienced child educators interested in leading day-long outings. Experiences and prices are outlined by the trip leader and include mountain and water sports. This is a door-to-door service where trip leaders provide transportation, handle all gear rental and  even food purchases (optional), and provide any medical services within their scope of training.
